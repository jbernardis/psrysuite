how to use wos1norm in yard

verify signal lever functionality and signal indicators for nassau/port/cliff/yard

verify the correct sequencing of subblocks
    S11: S11A, S11B
    R10: R10A, R10B, R10C
    H30: H30A, H30B

already verified these: eastbound => ABC ordering, westbound: CBA (S20 had B and C backwards - I reversed in software)
    D11: D11A, D11B
    D21: D21A, D21B
    S10: S10A, S10B, S10C
    S20: S20A, S20B, S20C
    H10: H10A, H10B
