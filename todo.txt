	ar/atc/advisor - ??get rid of checkboxes and have always on???


redesign ATC as a non-GUI program, add ATC frame to dispatcher (and display??) and use messages between the two to keep the display up to date




signal bits to mast heads: (is this still accurate, or does it represent the old tester with the reversed bit ordering)
000 = Red
100 = Red/Yellow
010 = Yellow/Green
110 = Red/Green
001 = Yellow/Red
101 = Red/Flashing Yellow
011 = Green/Red
111 = Red/Green

as per Bill Schaffer:

Clear             = Green/Red           011
Approach Medium   = Yellow/Green        010
Medium Clear      = Red/Green           111
Approach Slow     = Red/Yellow          110xxxx
Approach          = Yellow/Red          001
Medium Approach   = Red/Flashing Yellow 101
Slow Approach and                       100
Restricting       = Flashing Red/Red(Red/Yellow)
