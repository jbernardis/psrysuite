how to use release - yard nassau and cliff (I think nassau and yard are done)

call on signals - I think it refers to JUST lighting the signal with no route clearing etc

how to use wos1norm in yard

verify signal lever functionality and signal indicators for nassau/port/cliff/yard

verify the correct sequencing of subblocks
    S11: S11A, S11B
    R10: R10A, R10B, R10C
    H30: H30A, H30B

already verified these: eastbound => ABC ordering, westbound: CBA (S20 had B and C backwards - I reversed in software)
    D11: D11A, D11B
    D21: D21A, D21B
    S10: S10A, S10B, S10C
    S20: S20A, S20B, S20C
    H10: H10A, H10B
    
Make sure that all of the stopping blocks report in correctly as east versus west.  If they do NOT on the actual railroad, it means that the block definition is wrong.  Need a more robust algorithm for determining 
if a block is being traversed in its default direction or if it needs to be reversed.  This impacts dispatcher, but also sim/ar


general - better icons for everything, set icons for the programs themselves,

expand config to allow changing of ini file parameters

sniffer interface - a new process that sends messages to rrserver who then forwards them to all.

ar/atc/advisor - ??get rid of checkboxes and have always on???


check the order of signal definitions in port routes - had to change for P20P21 route - after doing this, regenerate the layout file and determine if trains/arscripts/simscripts needs to be updated
actually revisit port block definitions - only P50, P30, and P32 are where direction changes are needed.  Determine the
proper east/west orientation of the blocks (all yard tracks are east bound), determine proper stop block locations, and arrow directions.

tracker:
	backup/restore - need a backup/restore for the entire suite - not in tracker
	reports - the only thing we really need is train cards, and this is not in tracker, but in train editor

hand switch levers for port - there is not a separate 15a and 15b, also, I don't seem to be getting the input values when they change
