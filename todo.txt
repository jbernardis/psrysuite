how to use release - yard nassau and cliff (I think nassau and yard are done)

need to resolve fleeting in cliff - does cliff panel lever control sheffield/gm/cliveden, and bank, or just sheffield/gm.  How to reconcile with software
that has 3 controls - sheffield/gm, cliveben, and bank.  Make cb on screen work in conjunction with control field - disable fleet cb if control is local

port fleeting - is there a switch on the panel that we need to keep in sync with?

call on signals - I think it refers to JUST lighting the signal with no route clearing etc

how to use wos1norm in yard

verify signal lever functionality and signal indicators for nassau/port/cliff/yard

verify the correct sequencing of subblocks
    D11: D11A, D11B
    D21: D21A, D21B
    S10: S10A, S10B, S10C
    S11: S11A, S11B
    S20: S20A, S20B, S20C
    R10: R10A, R10B, R10C
    H10: H10A, H10B
    H30: H30A, H30B



installer - icons for everything, integrate with configurator for setting up different configurations



Train Edit
  change train length via start dlg box
  when determining order of sub-blocks need to reverse one of the two places in gen sim logic
    
add configuration changes to editor or add a separate configurator

config button - either always generate the layout file, or do it from rrserver via a request - that way the request could come from anywhere - like the editor/configurator

check the order of signal definitions in port routes - had to change for P20P21 route - after doing this, regenerate the layout file and determine if trains/arscripts/simscripts needs to be updated
