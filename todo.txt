possibilities:
	ar/atc/advisor - ??get rid of checkboxes and have always on???
	retire/get rid of advisor?????


redesign ATC as a non-GUI program, add ATC frame to dispatcher (and display??) and use messages between the two to keep the display up to date
	OR
keep it the way it is, but don't try to manage the window with respect to the mainframe - just allow it to be moved and treat it as an external application (which it is)



show events/advice should allow for locale (Port vs Cliff vs Yard, etc)
notes regarding locale:
	Port locale, Yard locale, Cliff Locale, and then Everywhere else
	allow for global on/off, and if on, allow for a locale
	
	popupAdvice:
		dispatcher/mainframe 7 occurrences
		
	popupEvent:
		dispatcher/districts:
			bank 3
			cliff 3
			cliveden 3
			latham 1
			nassau 4
			shore 1
			yard 2
		dispatcher:
			block 2
			district 23
			mainframe 30
			signal 1
			
			
add fields to active train list: time since assigned, stopped > 5 minutes
add new circus junction to display and update track diagram to include new track

when passing a signal and turning it red, the train should still be controlled by the signal aspect before it turned red until they pass out of the OS

work aspecttype into atc and use to set speed limits

when committing to python 3.12, make sure to update requirements.txt for correct version of wxPython(4.2.1 instead of 4.2.0)
