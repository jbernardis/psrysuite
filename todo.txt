how to use release - yard nassau and cliff (I think nassau and yard are done)

call on signals - I think it refers to JUST lighting the signal with no route clearing etc

how to use wos1norm in yard

verify signal lever functionality and signal indicators for cliff/yard

verify the correct sequencing of subblocks
    S11: S11A, S11B
    R10: R10A, R10B, R10C
    H30: H30A, H30B

already verified these: eastbound => ABC ordering, westbound: CBA (S20 had B and C backwards - I reversed in software)
    D11: D11A, D11B
    D21: D21A, D21B
    S10: S10A, S10B, S10C
    S20: S20A, S20B, S20C
    H10: H10A, H10B

general - better icons for everything, set icons for the programs themselves,

sniffer interface - a new process that sends messages to rrserver who then forwards them to all. - needs debugging

ar/atc/advisor - ??get rid of checkboxes and have always on???

tracker:
	backup/restore - need a backup/restore for the entire suite - not in tracker
	reports - the only thing we really need is train cards, and this is not in tracker, but in train editor

siding unlock levers from all tower panels - cliff

fleet levers from cliff


why was a single car train being reported as non-contiguous??

what happened when we lost detection


from first session testing:




Why couldn't I throw switches at times - in nassau, I believe it was because I didn't clear switch locks.  I think this is done - needs to be tested

I think server periodically crashes or has i/o errors that it can't recover from - why

train contiguous - do not show message is ?? train - disabled for now until we can figure out what's going on

verify all signal lights and turnout lights on all panels - 

verify proper panel operation
