how to use release - yard nassau and cliff

call on signals - I think it refers to JUST lighting the signal with no route clearing etc

how to use wos1norm in yard

do we really need a separate cliff fleet checkbox?  And what is port fleeting if we have no control over port

train identification when moving in reverse

operate turnout despite locks - ctrl-click or shift-click
  
Train Edit
  change len via ??
  work train length into interface
  when determining order of sub-blocks need to reverse one of the two places in gen sim logic
  edit for tracker also - locos done
  
relocate edit train dlg to lower screen position, to the left of popups


incorporate traintracker - move trains and locos admin outside the scope of tt


check the order of signal definitions in port routes - had to change for P20P21 route - after doing this, regenerate the layout file and determine if trains/arscripts/simscripts needs to be updated

need a way to turn off AR either when a train is first placed on the tracks or after it has reached its destination (not really a problem)
