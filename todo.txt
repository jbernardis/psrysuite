how to use release - yard nassau and cliff

call on signals - I think it refers to JUST lighting the signal with no route clearing etc

how to use wos1norm in yard

do we really need a separate cliff fleet checkbox?  And what is port fleeting if we have no control over port

Train Edit
  change len via start dlg box
  when determining order of sub-blocks need to reverse one of the two places in gen sim logic
    
relocate edit train dlg to lower screen position, to the left of popups
get the correct anchor location for a triple wide display


incorporate traintracker - move trains and locos admin outside the scope of tt

add configuration changes to editor or add a separate configurator

config button - either always generate the layout file, or do it from rrserver via a request - that way the request could come from anywhere - like the editor/configurator

check the order of signal definitions in port routes - had to change for P20P21 route - after doing this, regenerate the layout file and determine if trains/arscripts/simscripts needs to be updated
