call on signals - I think it refers to JUST lighting the signal with no route clearing etc

verify the correct sequencing of subblocks
    S11: S11A, S11B
    R10: R10A, R10B, R10C
    H30: H30A, H30B

already verified these: eastbound => ABC ordering, westbound: CBA (S20 had B and C backwards - I reversed in software)
    D11: D11A, D11B
    D21: D21A, D21B
    S10: S10A, S10B, S10C
    S20: S20A, S20B, S20C
    H10: H10A, H10B

sniffer interface - a new process that sends messages to rrserver who then forwards them to all. - needs debugging


tracker:
	backup/restore - need a backup/restore for the entire suite - not in tracker
	reports - the only thing we really need is train cards, and this is not in tracker, but in train editor

I think server periodically crashes or has i/o errors that it can't recover from - why

why was a single car train being reported as non-contiguous??
train contiguous - do not show message is ?? train - disabled for now until we can figure out what's going on

verify all signal lights and turnout lights on all panels - verify proper panel operation.  Verify lever operation and indicators
	nassau verified
	cliff
	yard verified
	port
	
verify signal lever functionality and signal indicators for cliff
what is supposed to happen when the operator presses the red buttons on their panels
siding unlock levers from all tower panels - cliff, port


new server:
still have to test port, cliff, hyde on the new server



possibilities:
	ar/atc/advisor - ??get rid of checkboxes and have always on???
