call on signals - I think it refers to JUST lighting the signal with no route clearing etc
implemented for when requested by dispatcher - not from a control panel yet
what is supposed to happen when the operator presses the red buttons on their panels

verify the correct sequencing of subblocks
    S11: S11A, S11B
    R10: R10A, R10B, R10C
    H30: H30A, H30B

already verified these: eastbound => ABC ordering, westbound: CBA (S20 had B and C backwards - I reversed in software)
    D11: D11A, D11B
    D21: D21A, D21B
    S10: S10A, S10B, S10C
    S20: S20A, S20B, S20C
    H10: H10A, H10B

sniffer interface - a new process that sends messages to rrserver who then forwards them to all. - needs debugging


tracker:
	reports - the only thing we really need is train cards - it stays in tracker because it works in conjunction with schedules

I think server periodically crashes or has i/o errors that it can't recover from - why
do we need a re-open logic in server to help to recover from serial issues

why was a single car train being reported as non-contiguous??
train contiguous - do not show message is ?? train - disabled for now until we can figure out what's going on

verify signal lever functionality and signal indicators for cliff
siding unlock levers from all tower panels - cliff
still need to resolve inverted fleet and siding indications from cliff

possibilities:
	ar/atc/advisor - ??get rid of checkboxes and have always on???
