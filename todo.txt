	ar/atc/advisor - ??get rid of checkboxes and have always on???


redesign ATC as a non-GUI program, add ATC frame to dispatcher (and display??) and use messages between the two to keep the display up to date




signal bits to mast heads: (is this still accurate, or does it represent the old tester with the reversed bit ordering)
000 = Red
100 = Red/Yellow
010 = Yellow/Green
110 = Red/Green
001 = Yellow/Red
101 = Red/Flashing Yellow
011 = Green/Red
111 = Red/Green

as per Bill Schaffer:

Clear             = Green/Red           011
Approach Medium   = Yellow/Green        010
Medium Clear      = Red/Green           111
Approach Slow     = Red/Yellow          110xxxx
Approach          = Yellow/Red          001
Medium Approach   = Red/Flashing Yellow 101
Slow Approach and                       100
Restricting       = Flashing Red/Red(Red/Yellow)

Everything seems to be OK now - maybe one here or there that's wrong, but largely correct

get signal bridge at east end junction working


ability to suppress specific trains from active train display

ability to unlock all sidings in support of waybills - but not have this condition block signals

tracker/engineers, and all aspects of train editor - get files through server so that they can be run anywhere
