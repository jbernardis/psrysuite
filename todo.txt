how to use release - yard nassau and cliff (I think nassau and yard are done)

need to resolve fleeting in cliff:
	if cliff enabled:
		look at cliff.fleet input and use that to set all 3 checkboxes, disable those checkboxes
		
	if cliff except bank/cliveden
		look at cliff.fleet and use that for the cliff checkbox, disable only cliff checkbox, and leave others enabled
		
	if dispatcher all enabled
		enable all checkboxes
		ignore cliff.fleet input
		
		
		
port fleeting - is there a switch on the panel that we need to keep in sync with?  is there porta versus portb fleeting>

call on signals - I think it refers to JUST lighting the signal with no route clearing etc

how to use wos1norm in yard

verify signal lever functionality and signal indicators for nassau/port/cliff/yard

verify the correct sequencing of subblocks
    S11: S11A, S11B
    R10: R10A, R10B, R10C
    H30: H30A, H30B

already verified these: eastbound => ABC ordering, westbound: CBA (S20 had B and C backwards - I reversed in software)
    D11: D11A, D11B
    D21: D21A, D21B
    S10: S10A, S10B, S10C
    S20: S20A, S20B, S20C
    H10: H10A, H10B
    
Make sure that all of the stopping blocks report in correctly as east versus west.  If they do NOT on the actual railroad, it means that the block definition is wrong.  Need a more robust algorithm for determining 
if a block is being traversed in its default direction or if it needs to be reversed.  This impacts dispatcher, but also sim/ar


installer - icons for everything, integrate with configurator for setting up different configurations



Train Edit
  change train length via start dlg box
  when determining order of sub-blocks need to reverse one of the two places in gen sim logic
    
add configuration changes to editor or add a separate configurator

config button - either always generate the layout file, or do it from rrserver via a request - that way the request could come from anywhere - like the editor/configurator

check the order of signal definitions in port routes - had to change for P20P21 route - after doing this, regenerate the layout file and determine if trains/arscripts/simscripts needs to be updated

tracker:
	backup/restore
	reports


solve bank signal 18 issue

faceoff trains 43/44 in cliveden - why didn't downhill train start after the other train cleared

AR should not be setting  switches or turnouts in port

need a better way to handle subblock ordering in P50 (and others???)
