how to use release - yard nassau and cliff (I think nassau and yard are done)

call on signals - I think it refers to JUST lighting the signal with no route clearing etc

how to use wos1norm in yard

verify signal lever functionality and signal indicators for nassau/port/cliff/yard

verify the correct sequencing of subblocks
    S11: S11A, S11B
    R10: R10A, R10B, R10C
    H30: H30A, H30B

already verified these: eastbound => ABC ordering, westbound: CBA (S20 had B and C backwards - I reversed in software)
    D11: D11A, D11B
    D21: D21A, D21B
    S10: S10A, S10B, S10C
    S20: S20A, S20B, S20C
    H10: H10A, H10B

general - better icons for everything, set icons for the programs themselves,

sniffer interface - a new process that sends messages to rrserver who then forwards them to all. - needs debugging

ar/atc/advisor - ??get rid of checkboxes and have always on???

clear up the cryptic advisor messages


tracker:
	backup/restore - need a backup/restore for the entire suite - not in tracker
	reports - the only thing we really need is train cards, and this is not in tracker, but in train editor

siding unlock levers from all tower panels - cliff

fleet levers from port/cliff

why do I have a fleet checkbox for port since we have no control over port AND there is no fleet switch on the port panel??

should C18RA/RB/L be included with bank fleeting and 14R/LA/LB be included with cliveden?  Right now they are not affected by fleeting.




why was a single car train being reported as non-contiguous??

what happened when we lost detection

train 57 moving through block P50 - block loses "cleared" status and turns white as train moves through it - why?


==> test ==> Nassau - fleet is working, but I can't find anything to affect the panel lights

==> test ==> Look closer and signal 18L - it would not clear route from N21 <=> N32

==> test ==> port B - I'm receiving the handswitch settings for Sw5 and 15a/b, and I'm turning on the on-screen arrows, but I'm not updating the input object nor am I changing the panel lights

==> test this out and then move to ini file - pay attention to position of ATC ==> Need a configurable offset for 1) entire window, 2) toasters,  3) ATC window?, 4) others???
need to check into window "Make this the main display" setting and how this issue is affected by it.

Need a way to initiate/terminate ATC from a display process
