how to use release - yard nassau and cliff

call on signals - I think it refers to JUST lighting the signal with no route clearing etc

how to use wos1norm in yard

do we really need a separate cliff fleet checkbox?  And what is port fleeting if we have no control over port



verify signal lever functionality and signal indicators for nassau/port/cliff/yard

verify the correct sequencing of subblocks
    D11: D11A, D11B
    D21: D21A, D21B
    S10: S10A, S10B, S10C
    S11: S11A, S11B
    S20: S20A, S20B, S20C
    R10: R10A, R10B, R10C
    H10: H10A, H10B
    H30: H30A, H30B



installer - icons for everything, integrate with configurator for setting up different configurations



Train Edit
  change train length via start dlg box
  when determining order of sub-blocks need to reverse one of the two places in gen sim logic
    
relocate edit train dlg to lower screen position, to the left of popups
also location of popups when triple wide
get the correct anchor location for a triple wide display


add configuration changes to editor or add a separate configurator

config button - either always generate the layout file, or do it from rrserver via a request - that way the request could come from anywhere - like the editor/configurator

check the order of signal definitions in port routes - had to change for P20P21 route - after doing this, regenerate the layout file and determine if trains/arscripts/simscripts needs to be updated
