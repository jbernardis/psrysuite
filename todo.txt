retire/get rid of advisor?????   tracker????

when committing to python 3.12, make sure to update requirements.txt for correct version of wxPython(4.2.1 instead of 4.2.0)

change everywhere that shows an internal OS name to show the route name instead

move all dialog boxes to center of screen (unless that are fixed elsewhere for another reason)

automate management of single track if dispatcher all or dispatcher cliveden/martinsville:
    EB train entering B11 or B21 or leaves COSCLW
    WB train entering C23, C12 or leaving BOSE


cliff fleeting - physical lever controls martinsville, cliveden and green mountain - NOT SHEFFIELD
when the cliff control is set to all, cliff controls everything.
When it is set to dispatch all, the dispatcher controls everything
When set to dispatcher controls bank/cliveden, cliff only controls sheffield, green mountain, and cliveden.  Dispatcher controls single track and martinsville/bank


train routing - give a warning if a train enters a block that is not in its route - and a way to acknowledge and therefore ignore future such warnings

finish up train block order:
    active trains, display, satellite impact (display mostly done)
    test thoroughly

restructure settrain command to imply block order with blocks
