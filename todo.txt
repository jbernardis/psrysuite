call on signals initiated by tower operator

verify the correct sequencing of subblocks
    S11: S11A, S11B
    R10: R10A, R10B, R10C
    H30: H30A, H30B

already verified these: eastbound => ABC ordering, westbound: CBA (S20 had B and C backwards - I reversed in software)
    D11: D11A, D11B
    D21: D21A, D21B
    S10: S10A, S10B, S10C
    S20: S20A, S20B, S20C
    H10: H10A, H10B

sniffer interface - a new process that sends messages to rrserver who then forwards them to all. - needs debugging


tracker:
	reports - the only thing we really need is train cards - it stays in tracker because it works in conjunction with schedules


why was a single car train being reported as non-contiguous??
train contiguous - do not show message is ?? train - disabled for now until we can figure out what's going on

possibilities:
	ar/atc/advisor - ??get rid of checkboxes and have always on???


redesign ATC as a non-GUI program, add ATC frame to dispatcher (and display??) and use messages between the two to keep the display up to date


why don't I see the AR/ARC on the active train display for a remote display?

why don't I see speed on the active train display




signal bits to mast heads: (is this still accurate, or does it represent the old tester with the reversed bit ordering)
000 = Red
100 = Red/Yellow
010 = Yellow/Green
110 = Red/Green
001 = Yellow/Red
101 = Red/Flashing Yellow
011 = Green/Red
111 = Red/Green

as per Bill Schaffer:

Clear             = Green/Red           011
Approach Medium   = Yellow/Green        010
Medium Clear      = Red/Green           111
Approach Slow     = Red/Yellow          110xxxx
Approach          = Yellow/Red          001
Medium Approach   = Red/Flashing Yellow 101
Slow Approach and                       100
Restricting       = Flashing Red/Red(Red/Yellow)


Need to verify aspects with fixed tester program.  Also need to take note of bit order and make sure I am using the same order in server



When a train passes westbound through N31, it changes to the identity of the train parkes in N32

West and East stopping sections for P31/P32 seem to be reversed, should I change the definition of the stopping bliock, or just change the interpretation of the input bits

over-ride button versus callon

ability to suppress specific trains from active train display

Do I have stop blocks backwards east of nassau in B and.or R blocks???

refine aspect calculation debugging information

revisit fleeting algorithm - should signals work as a group or as individual signals?  If I change the route through the OS, if a signal fleets back to green, should it go with the new route, or just be abandoned>
