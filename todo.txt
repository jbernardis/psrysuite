how to use release - yard nassau and cliff
call on signals - I think it refers to JUST lighting the signal with no route clearing etc
how to use wos1norm in yard
do we really need a separate cliff fleet checkbox?  And what is port fleeting if we have no control over port

checking train for non-contiguous Blocks

ATC
 need dcc interface - dcc server that will be used for both atc and throttle
 need to resolve starting and stopping in the same block - this requires 2 entries in the script, but that can't be
 after train reaches its terminus, we should be able to clear out the far stopping section - this is not necessarily an ATC issue, it was just discovered here

Auto routing
  interface needs work
  
Train Edit
  change time/trigger via ??
  work train length into interface
  
dispatcher in dispatch mode automatically starts rrserver (and rrserver automatically starts dcc server??)
