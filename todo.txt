Pondering/Future
****************
ar/atc - ??get rid of checkboxes and have always on???

retire/get rid of tracker????

modify notification of train routing into an invalid block to be settable on a train by train basis instead of being global

when committing to python 3.12, make sure to update requirements.txt for correct version of wxPython(4.2.1 instead of 4.2.0)




To Be Tested
************
automate management of single track if dispatcher all or dispatcher cliveden/martinsville:
    EB train entering B11 or B21 or leaves COSCLW
    WB train entering C23, C12 or leaving BOSE


cliff fleeting - physical lever controls martinsville, cliveden and green mountain - NOT SHEFFIELD
when the cliff control is set to all, cliff controls everything.
When it is set to dispatch all, the dispatcher controls everything
When set to dispatcher controls bank/cliveden, cliff only controls sheffield, green mountain, and cliveden.  Dispatcher controls single track (and it's end OSes) and martinsville/bank




To Be designed/Implemented
**************************

revisit locale.  In ini file:
    locale=...

    Dispatcher and satellite see all without consideration of ini file entries

    Displays only see if showevents or showadvice are set to true and the following:
        if locale is specified, they only see messages marked with that locale
        otherwise they see everything

inspection interface
     look into signal lever position.  For some locales, we should probably reverse L/R on this screen
        cliff and yard seem to be ok, but nassau and port are reversed.  I think all of them are backwards, and the
        cliff and yard should be reversed on the display.  I really need to verify actual operation with what I see in the software
