call on signals initiated by tower operator

verify the correct sequencing of subblocks
    S11: S11A, S11B
    R10: R10A, R10B, R10C
    H30: H30A, H30B

already verified these: eastbound => ABC ordering, westbound: CBA (S20 had B and C backwards - I reversed in software)
    D11: D11A, D11B
    D21: D21A, D21B
    S10: S10A, S10B, S10C
    S20: S20A, S20B, S20C
    H10: H10A, H10B

sniffer interface - a new process that sends messages to rrserver who then forwards them to all. - needs debugging


tracker:
	reports - the only thing we really need is train cards - it stays in tracker because it works in conjunction with schedules

I think server periodically crashes or has i/o errors that it can't recover from - why
do we need a re-open logic in server to help to recover from serial issues
reopen fixed the problem, and provided a cleaner way to recover - but perhaps it can be enhanced - to happen automatically, and to try to remember train and loco IDs

why was a single car train being reported as non-contiguous??
train contiguous - do not show message is ?? train - disabled for now until we can figure out what's going on

verify signal lever functionality and signal indicators for cliff
siding unlock levers from all tower panels - cliff
still need to resolve inverted fleet and siding indications from cliff

possibilities:
	ar/atc/advisor - ??get rid of checkboxes and have always on???


redesign ATC as a non-GUI program, add ATC frame to dispatcher (and display??) and use messages between the two to keep the display up to date


why don't I see the AR/ARC on the active train display for a remote display?

why don't I see speed on the active train display


a button or other method for changing train direction


signal bits to mast heads:
000 = Red
100 = Yellow/Green
010 = Red/Yellow
110 = Red/Green
001 = Red/Red
101 = Yellow/Green
011 = Red/Yellow
111 = Red/Green



When a train passes westbound through N31, it changes to the identity of the train parkes in N32

West and East stopping sections for P31/P32 seem to be reversed, should I change the definition of the stopping bliock, or just change the interpretation of the input bits

When adding a new train, instead of defaulting to east bound, it should take on the direction of the block.  If the train then changes direction after being identified, the block should be changed.

reverse the signal heads for port B
